# Html-Css-JavaScript
Created 6 projects using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

PROJECT 1: YOUR AGE IN DAYS
This project prompts the user to enter their year of birth and calculates the number of days you've lived so far. It has the "click me" and the "reset" button. The "click me" button, once clicked, displays the number of days the user has lived. The "Reset" button clears the text that is displayed.

PROJECT 2: DOG GENERATOR
This project consists of a "Generate Dog" button, where the user can generate 'n' number of dog gif's. 

PROJECT 3: ROCK, PAPER OR SCISSORS
Made a game of rock,paper or scissors. The user and the computer has to choose one of the above options. The computer chooses one of the options using the random().
HOW THE GAME WORKS?
A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors" or "breaks scissors" or sometimes "blunts scissors"), but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper") etc.

PROJECT 4: CHANGE THE COLOUR OF ALL BUTTONS
In this project, few options are provided to the user. The colour of the buttons are changed according to waht the user clicks. 

PROJECT 5: BLACKJACK 
In this game, the user plays against the computer. There are three buttons as shown-Hit,Stand and the Deal button.

HOW THE GAME WORKS?
Each participant attempts to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21. It is up to each individual player if an ace is worth 1 or 11. Face cards are 10 and any other card is its pip value.

The participant can be done with their chance and pass it on to the computer if they think at a certain point that the value of their cards are going to be over 21. Now, if the computer manages to get the value of the cards above the participants, then the computer wins. Otherwise, if the computer manages to get a lesser value or manages to go beyond 21,then the participant wins.
